### Add or remove labels to threads
When you add or remove a label to a thread, you add or remove the specified
label on all existing messages in the thread.
If messages are added to a thread after you add a label, the new messages
don't inherit the existing label associated with the thread. To add the label
to those messages, add the label to the thread again.
To add or remove the labels associated with a thread, use
[threads.modify](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/threads/modify).

```
threads.modify
```

### Add or remove labels to messages
When you add a label to a message, the label is added to that message and
becomes associated with the thread to which the message belongs. The label isn't
added to other messages within the thread.
If you remove a label from a message and it was the only message in the thread
with that label, the label is also removed from the thread.
To add or remove the labels applied to a message, use
[messages.modify](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/v1/reference/users/messages/modify).

```
messages.modify
```
